  "puzzle_id": "007bbfb7",
  "output_grid": [[...]]
}
```

**Response (Command):**
```json
{
  "type": "command",
  "command": "set_color",
  "result": {
    "success": true,
    "grid": [[...]]

}
```

### Color Mapping
- 0: Black
- 1: Blue
- 2: Red
- 3: Green
- 4: Yellow
- 5: Gray
- 6: Pink/Magenta

- "Color position 4,4 green"
- "Resize output to 5x5"
- "Clear the output"
- "Copy from input"
- "Fill from 0,0 to 2,2 with yellow"

#### Analysis Questions
- "What is the grid size for input 2?"
- "What color is input cell 3,4?"
- "How many training examples are there?"
- "Analyze the pattern"

### UI Integration
- Chat window positioned on the right side of the editor
- Dark theme matching ARC Prize interface
- Auto-scrolling message display
- Enter key support for sending messages
- Markdown-style formatting in responses

### Testing Results
âœ… Grid editing commands work correctly
âœ… Color parsing (names and numbers) functional
âœ… Resize operations preserve existing data
âœ… Question answering retrieves correct puzzle data
âœ… Pattern analysis provides insights
âœ… Help system displays available commands

## Usage Instructions

1. **Load a puzzle** in the editor
2. **Open the AI chat** (automatically visible on the right)
3. **Type commands** in natural language
4. **Press Enter** or click Send
5. **Watch the grid update** in real-time

The AI assistant automatically:
- Understands the current puzzle context
- Tracks the output grid state
- Provides feedback on command execution
- Offers help when needed

## Future Enhancements
- More complex pattern recognition
- Solution suggestions based on training examples
- Batch command execution
- Undo/redo functionality
- Voice input support
