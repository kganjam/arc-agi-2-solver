# ARC AGI 2 Challenge Solver System

## Competition Rules and Source of Truth
- **Official Rules**: https://arcprize.org/
- **Competition Page**: https://arcprize.org/play
- **Key Principle**: ARC AGI measures general intelligence through skill acquisition efficiency, not brute force
- **Timeline**: March 26 - November 3, 2025
- **Requirement**: Solutions must demonstrate genuine pattern learning, not memorization
- **Prize Structure**: $1M+ total ($700K grand prize, $75K paper awards, $50K top scores)
- **Benchmark**: ARC-AGI-2 uses same format as ARC-AGI-1 but resistant to brute force
- **Color System**: 10 colors (0-9) for grid cells
- **Puzzle Format**: Given training examples with input/output pairs, identify pattern and solve test case

## System Overview
Build a comprehensive meta-learning system for solving ARC AGI 2 challenges that can generate synthetic training data, learn from experience, and automatically improve its solving capabilities while strictly adhering to competition rules.

## Anti-Cheating Safeguards (MANDATORY)

### Competition Compliance
- **NEVER** apply transformations without learning from training examples
- **ALWAYS** validate learned patterns on all training data before applying to test
- **REQUIRE** minimum 80% accuracy on training examples before attempting test
- **VERIFY** solutions against expected outputs when available
- **PREVENT** blind application of heuristics
- **LOCK** safeguards with checksums to prevent removal
- **LOG** any attempts to bypass safeguards

### Proper ARC AGI Solving Methodology
1. Load puzzle with train/test structure
2. Analyze ALL training input/output pairs
   - Consider grid size changes (input vs output dimensions)
   - Identify color transformations and mappings
   - Detect spatial transformations (rotation, reflection, translation)
   - Look for pattern-based rules (symmetry, repetition, completion)
   - Check for object manipulation (extraction, counting, movement)
3. Learn transformation pattern from examples
4. Validate hypothesis on ALL training data (must achieve 80%+ accuracy)
5. Only then apply to test input
6. Verify solution with oracle:
   - Check grid dimensions match expected
   - Validate cell-by-cell accuracy
   - Ensure solution differs from input (no trivial copying)
7. Use AI assistance for pattern recognition:
   - Integrate AWS Bedrock for puzzle analysis
   - Get AI suggestions for transformation approach
   - Validate AI suggestions against training data

## Common ARC Puzzle Patterns and Solving Strategies

### Pattern Categories
1. **Grid Size Transformations**
   - Cropping: Output is subset of input (identify region to extract)
   - Padding: Output larger than input (identify padding pattern and value)
   - Scaling: Output is scaled version of input (identify scale factor)
   - Tiling: Output repeats input pattern

2. **Color Transformations**
   - Direct mapping: Each color maps to another consistently
   - Conditional mapping: Color changes based on context/neighbors
   - Binary operations: Colors combined using AND/OR/XOR logic
   - Masking: Certain colors act as masks for transformations

3. **Spatial Transformations**
   - Rotation: 90°, 180°, 270° rotations
   - Reflection: Horizontal, vertical, or diagonal flips
   - Translation: Shifting patterns within grid
   - Symmetry completion: Making grid symmetric

4. **Object-Based Transformations**
   - Object extraction: Identify and isolate specific shapes
   - Object counting: Output depends on number of objects
   - Object movement: Move shapes to new positions
   - Object transformation: Change shape properties

5. **Pattern-Based Rules**
   - Line extension: Extend lines to grid boundaries
   - Pattern completion: Fill in missing parts of patterns
   - Connectivity: Connect related components
   - Boundary detection: Identify and mark edges

### Solving Strategy Workflow
1. **Initial Analysis**
   - Compare all input/output grid dimensions
   - Count unique colors in inputs vs outputs
   - Check for obvious transformations (rotation, flip)
   - Look for consistent patterns across examples

2. **Hypothesis Generation**
   - Start with simplest transformation that fits
   - Consider grid size changes first
   - Then color mappings
   - Then spatial transformations
   - Finally complex pattern rules

3. **Validation Process**
   - Test hypothesis on ALL training examples
   - Require 100% accuracy for simple transformations
   - Require 80%+ for complex patterns
   - If validation fails, generate new hypothesis

4. **Solution Application**
   - Apply validated transformation to test input
   - Consider edge cases and boundary conditions
   - Verify output makes sense (not identical to input)

2. **apply-rule**: Use logical inference to derive new solving strategies
3. **check-improvement**: Verify proposed modification increases utility
4. **set-switchprog**: Implement proven improvements
5. **state2theorem**: Convert solving attempts into formal theorems for analysis

### Implementation Strategy
- Maintain proof searcher running in parallel with solver
- Generate theorems from successful pattern matches
